# Release Early

Release Early, Release Often is an agile concept for teams of developers. 

In this post, I will argue that you should follow this principle in personal open source projects as well.

## Why?
* Itâ€™s OK for the first release to be underwhelming and filled with imperfections. As long as you refactor, the codebase will grow to be high quality.
* You're not fooling anyone. Everyone's early code sucks and mistakes are made all the time.
* Avoid analysis paralysis.
* You canâ€™t optimize for the things that matter until you get actual feedback anyway.
* Because other people will see your commits, this will force you to develop in a more structured manner and write better commit messages. You may not feel it, but best practices are there to help you.
* Other people can work on it as well ðŸ™‚

## Why not?
* If youâ€™re making big, fundamental changes. Then you may want to hold off the release to double and triple check everything.
* If realease or feature is buggy, or badly implemented.
